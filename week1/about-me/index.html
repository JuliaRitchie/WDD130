        <h2>Julia ;)</h2>
        <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Julia Ritchie and I am an Interdisciplinary major. This is my 3rd semester at BYU-I, so technically I am still considered a freshman.</p>
        <p>My emphasis is in Creative Writing for Fiction/Film, I will be getting a minor in Web Development, and a certificate in Digital Marketing. 
            The plan is to write screenplays and use my technical skills to market myself. I am mainly taking this class as part of my Web Development course. </p>
        <p>I like to write and crochet in my freetime. For those of you who don't know, crocheting is a handcraft similar to knitting where the crocheter can make 
            cool items like dolls and stuffed animals as well as scarves and other articles of clothing. Along with writing, I enjoy reading book series. 
            My favorite genres are dystopian and fantasy books, so some of my favorite book series include the Lunar Chronicles, Hunger Games, and Fablehaven. I also like 
            to sing and play piano. I am an active member of Concert Choir on campus and had the opportunity last semester to sing in General Conference with the other 
            BYU-I students. 
        </p>
        <p>I am excited to get to know you all and cannot wait to see where this semester will take us!</p>
