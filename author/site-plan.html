      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Once upon a time, the classic intro to many fairytales. These words were immortalized as an opening used by English writers who achieved fame through their dedication. 
          The writing industry has become more closed to the point that authors who once gained prominence with their skillful writing are being replaced by midtier writers who happen to have a connection. 
          So how do we fix that? My website will allow publishers and writers to interact openly as writers will submit writing samples like posts that publishers can scroll through and then contact writers who fit the writing they are looking for. 
          Similarly, publishers can publish job postings to draw in writers who can then send in writing that fits the criteria. It will interact as a niche website for writers who can go to earn an extra buck.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Writers who decide to try and get published, but have not been able to. They are mainly people who are looking for jobs or side-gigs.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People come to the site to submit writing samples that will be viewed by other writers and publishers. Writers will use this site as a way to network with publishers kind of like how LinkedIn allows you to interact with potential employers. Publishers will be able to find new talent and match perfectly with the genre they are looking for. Authors will receive the website free while publishers will have to pay for their jobs to be promoted on the site. The best part about this website is that the people visiting the site will be able to look at writing and get some content without having to write anything. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The first question this site should be able to answer is how to get published effectively. There will be a page with good beginner tips for how to start writing in the program and tips and tricks to improve writing. I want to foster a community of writers supporting each other that will get writers successfully published and encourage all to be the best writer they can become. Any frequently Asked Questions will be addressed as users send in some to the help page. Beyond this class, this page will hopefully have a team working on developing the different facets of it.

      </ul>
      <h3>Writing Samples</h3>
      <p>
        The website will probably have different prompts of the day and things like that which will allow readers to be entered into random forums with other writers and write a 100 word sample that other authors could comment on and give feedback to. There will also be a more professional side of things where the employers will post a job with a specific writing description that people can then submit tailored writing samples to. This will help publishers receive targeted sample writing rather than having writers submit writing that is not in the right genre, form, etc. Some other features will eventually include a student version where there will be 8th grade to high school and college which will allow aspiring writers to compete in quarterly competitions for their age range to submit essays, short stories, and poetry. The rewards will include some scholarships and the students will be given feedback for how to improve upon their writing.

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        The person entering the site will only need to have a good Wi-Fi connection in order to see anything on the website. All content is free to view on the public sphere, but to make content, or react to any content an account with the website is required. I intend on putting in a verification feature that can automatically connect with a Google or Facebook account. Eventually, there will be an algorithm that will be able to tailor certain writers to certain publishers based on shared writing descriptions, clicked on links, etc. Right now, however, there will be a more limited version that is view only for all of the content and features. I will be using example images and items like that to illustrate my vision for the site in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is unique in that the people coming to it are writers who want to pick up some jobs and maybe even find a good publishing company to write for. The goal of this site is to encourage more transparency in the publishing industry because publishers are acting more arbitrary in their publishing standards, which is making publishing harder and more complicated to do. The way to maximize the most out of this website would be for employers to post several low-paying jobs for some simple writing and then one big prompt that they pay to promote. Writers can maximize this website by applying for many small jobs and fill in 2 or 3 large writing samples a week.
