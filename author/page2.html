            "I gripped my coat closer to me as I entered the school building. 
            The little flurries of snow brushed my face with their unforgiving fingertips. 
            Such a spell of snow was not uncommon in my home city Jade, but after having acclimated to the pleasant heat of Mauve, my body began shivering. 
            Today was career selection, and as the only person my age from Jade, I would have to contact my parents following the conference. 
            I pulled open the door and took refuge inside the building, my glasses fogging over with the blessed warmth. 
            My nerves hummed as I pulled out my phone and sent a text to my parents, informing them of my location and my safety. 
            I looked at the closest sign, which had a group of teenagers crowded to read it. 
            Today was the end of Career Selection, which is a process that started over 3 months ago.

        </p>
        <p>
            Career Selection starts in November with a test. 
            Everyone wanting to enter the workforce is required to take this test to determine aptitude in certain fields. 
            The test comprises of four parts: History, Science, Math, and Reading/Editing. 
            The next part is getting the invitation and train ticket booked to attend the ceremony. 
            Lastly is the ceremony, where everyone receives their grades and their recommended career choice. 
            The old requirement for this whole process was to be 18 to take the test, however the council announced in April that the age was lowered to 17, and my 17th birthday was right on the deadline, causing me to have to take the test in December. 
            I took it and received my invitation the following week. Now, I only needed to stress out for a few more hours."
